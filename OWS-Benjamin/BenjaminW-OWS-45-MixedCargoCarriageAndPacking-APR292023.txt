In the early morning I drove through Marseilles to the station,
and as I passed familiar places on my way, and then new, unfamiliar
ones or others that I remembered only vaguely, the
city became a book in my hands, into which I hurriedly glanced
a few last times before it passed from my sight for who knows
how long into a warehouse crate.
