To great writers, finished works weigh lighter than those fragments
on which they work throughout their lives. For only the
more feeble and distracted take an inimitable pleasure in conclusions,
feeling themselves thereby given back to life. For the
genius each caesura, and the heavy blows of fate, fall like gentle
sleep itself into his workshop labour. About it he draws a charmed
circle of fragments. "Genius is application."
