I saw in a dream barren terrain. It was the marketplace at
Weimar. Excavations were in progress. I too scraped about in
the sand. Then the tip of a church steeple came to light.
Delighted, I thought to myself: a Mexican shrine from the time
of pre-animism, from the Anaquivitzli. I awoke laughing.
(Ana = รกvรก; vi = vie; witz [joke] = Mexican church[!].)
