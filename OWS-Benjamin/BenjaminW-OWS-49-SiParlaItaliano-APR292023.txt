I sat at night in violent pain on a bench. Opposite me on
another two girls sat down. They seemed to want to discuss
something in confidence and began to whisper. Nobody except
me was nearby and I should not have understood their Italian
however loud it had been. But now I could not resist the feeling,
in face of this unmotivated whispering in a language inaccessible
to me, that a cool dressing was being applied to the painful place.
