Like someone performing the giant swing on the horizontal bar,
each boy spins for himself the wheel of fortune from which,
sooner or later, the momentous lot shall fall. For only that which
we knew or practised at fifteen will one day constitute our
attraction. And one thing, therefore, can never be made good:
having neglected to run away from home. From forty-eight
hours' exposure in those years, as in a caustic solution, the
crystal of life's happiness forms.
